I am currently a senior AI researcher in Intelligent Computing research center at [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/), focusing on Generative Model and Reinforcement Learning.

I obtained master from [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Bachelor from Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to conduct thesis research under supervision of [Prof. Dibo Hou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/houdb), [Prof. Dr. Patrick van der Smagt](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=5ybzvbsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Sami Haddadin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Haddadin), [Dr. Alexandros Paraschos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aCz_QHUAAAAJ), and [Dr. Nutan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HH3n9scAAAAJ&hl=de).


## Research interest

My research wish is to build a robust, fully automated system with learning-based methods in the challenging and uncertain real-world. Particularly, I am keen to conduct research in the interdisciplinary area of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, with passion for precise robotic perception and decision-making in a complicated and non-stationary environment. My interests in autonomous system deepened during my Internship in Bosch, about vision-based Perception with GAN technique in Stuttgart, for L5 autonomous driving Athena, a joint project of Robert Bosch GmbH and Daimler.

My research interest locates in the following area:

* Generative Model
* Robot Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

## Research Projects

- **Conditional VAE in Human-Robot Interaction** 

Deep Learning for robot motion planning in human-robot interaction (HRI). We propose a real-time probabilistic model using LSTM-based conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for structured robot control policy learning and inference. 

**Supervisor**: [Prof. Dr. Patrick van der Smagt](https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt/), [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Sami Haddadin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Haddadin)

**Keynotes**: Variational AutoEncoder, BiLSTM, Human-Robot Interaction, Learning from Demonstration

- **Car racing game playing**

Apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG specifically) to control [Torcs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/torcs/) (a car racing game) agent's movement. At each time step, car can move by steering, accelerating and braking.
